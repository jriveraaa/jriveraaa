I am a student at Universidad del Azuay where I had the opportunity to learn about all the tech world, how to solve problems and how to build a good product so I can help people with their needs or sometimes my own needs, whether it's creating a program or a specific tool.

 <summary><h4>My Coding Journey</h4></summary>
 I've always been deeply passionate about technology since I was a kid, I started on my first year of college in 2022 when I got into CS at Universidad del Azuay, that's where I made my first program, a hello world program on C++, the next semesters my college started teaching us Java, that's when I started to deep dive into programming and how can I create tools that actually help me on a daily basis, after that on college course a teacher started talking about Python, I heard about it but never stuck with it, after that I started to built projects I truly believed and really enjoyed.
